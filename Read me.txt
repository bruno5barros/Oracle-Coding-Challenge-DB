Hi everyone,

I hope you are doing great.
This is my solution to the coding challenge. I developed my solution over SQL Developer.

In oder to test my solution, you have to run my solution in following order in SQL Developer:
# 1 - SQL Scripts(folder)
	- Create the tables and relatioship by runing (AppendixDataStructures.sql);
	- Insert all departments by runing (InsertDepartments.sql);
	- Insert all Employees by runing (InsertEmployees.sql);
	- Get requested reports by runing (EmployeeReport.sql);
	- Create the sequence to be used in our employee package by runing (Sequence.sql);

# 2 - PL SQL PKG(folder)
	- Create a package and copy and paste the code into these files (PKG_EMPLOYEE.pls & PKG_EMPLOYEE_BODY.pls);

# 3 - PL SQL Test(folder)
	- In order to run these tests you have to install utPLSQL;
	- Create a package and copy and paste the code into these files (TEST_PKG_EMPLOYEE.pls & test_pkg_employee_body.pls);

Thank you for the opportunity.

Kind regards,
Bruno Barros
